README for MeggyRef/RegressionTesting/
======================================
MJSIM.jar (revision 157 from http://code.google.com/p/mjsim/source/list), 
1/20/13, MMS
Anytime a new version of the MeggySim simulator (MJSIM.jar) is generated,
this file should be updated with the revision number for that program.


All of the .java files in the WorkingTestCases/ and 
WorkingErrorTestCases/ subdirectories will be run with the 
Java-only version and be run through the ../MJ.jar
compiler to generate AVR assembly that is then run through the
MJSIM.jar in batch mode.  The text output from both should match.


To run the regression tests:
    Put files in WorkingTestCases/ or WorkingErrorTestCases/
    subdirectories.
    
    ./regress.sh
    
    ./regress.sh SomeSubDir/filename.java 
        If want to run regression on a single input file.
        Yes it HAS to be in a subdirectory because of how the
        script works.


To clean up all those .s, .dot, and .java files in this
directory after running regress.sh:
    rm -rf *.s *.dot *.java *.class meggy/*.class output.log t1 t2
    
We could have the regress.sh clean up these files, but sometimes
for debugging it helps to have them around to look at.
